# Quorum-Sensing 
This repositoty contains the code for the transmodal spoon, part of the gastronomic expirience call Quorum Sensing.    
Quorum Sensing is a gastrosonic experience for three guests. A soup is served in a glass tableware designed from an experiment of associations of shapes and materials with musical emotions. The actions of each diner produce vibrations applied to the body of the others.  
The conceptual framework of this experience is multiple: relating the human experience with that of bacteria, tactilely increasing the sense of presence in commensality, sensory design of tableware and a reflection on the use of cell phones and tablets at the table. In the future, the experience may function as an experimental device to investigate these aspects as well as the impact of vibrations on the perception of food.  
The system for the spoons use a esp8266, program with the Arduino IDE, a MPU-6050, the Mosquitto MQTT Broker, a DAW and a Processing sketch.
